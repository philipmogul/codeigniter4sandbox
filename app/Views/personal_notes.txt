# This are my personal notes to help me master codeigniter 

# Making Auth Controller & AdminController to control authorizations of logins 

php spark make:controller AuthController 
# New File in Controllers/AuthController.php 


php spark make:controller AdminController 
# New File in Controllers/AdminController.php 


# In Librabries Folder, I created 2 Files: Hash.php + CIAuth.php
# Hash will help create a hash password and compare to password received by user to what is in database 
# CIAuth helps store verified admin credentials in sessions 


# Removing visibility of pages eg index.php 
# Create a .htacess file and paste the following 
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
</IfModule>

# The Go app/Config/App.php and remove index.php from public string $indexPage


# Filters help protect routes eg when logged out you cant see home page and when logged in 
you cant go back to index page 
# Create terminal in filter 
: php spark make:filter CIFilter 
# It wiil be created in the filters folder 
# paste authorizations code 
# Open app/Config/Filters.php = reg CIFilters as ALias 
# Open routes.php = apply filters on route groups
